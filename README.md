# csharp2crayon
C# to Crayon converter

This is specifically intended to be used to convert the Crayon compiler codebase (written in C#) to Crayon.
I may adapt this to be more generic later and will try to not burn too many bridges for making this generic, but really that single use is all this is for (at least for now).
